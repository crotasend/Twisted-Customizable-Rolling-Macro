# Twisted-Customizable-Rolling-Macro

# *------------ HOW TO USE -----------------*

1. Set up your Roblox Twisted private server to be on the LEFT half of your screen.
2. Open Roblox Player to the right half of your screen and then close it **at least once** so it defaults to opening there.
3. Open the script, and press Ctrl + K to manage your settings and change the minimum VTP to whatever you wish.
4. Press Ctrl + J to run the actual macro, then pay attention to where it moves your mouse to AFTER you confirm your settings.
5. Line up the "Join" button on which ever private server you wish to use to wherever it moved your mouse to.
6. Either wait ~5 seconds for it to automatically re-press join, or press it.
7. The script will now automatically run entirely, moving your mouse is **NOT reccomended** unless you are confirming / denying keeping a server.
8. **MAKE SURE THAT YOUR CHAT IS *HIDDEN* UPON LAUNCHING ROBLOX, AND THAT YOUR TASKBAR IS *DISABLED***
