# Twisted-Customizable-Rolling-Macro

# *------------ HOW TO USE -----------------*

1. Set up your Roblox Twisted private server to be on the LEFT half of your screen.
2. Open Roblox Player to the right half of your screen and then close it **at least once** so it defaults to opening there.
3. Open the script, and press Ctrl + K to manage your settings and change the minimum VTP to whatever you wish.
4. Press Ctrl + J to run the actual macro, then pay attention to where it moves your mouse to AFTER you confirm your settings.
5. Line up the "Join" button on which ever private server you wish to use to wherever it moved your mouse to.
6. Either wait ~5 seconds for it to automatically re-press join, or press it.
7. The script will now automatically run entirely, moving your mouse is **NOT reccomended** unless you are confirming / denying keeping a server.
8. **MAKE SURE THAT YOUR CHAT IS *HIDDEN* UPON LAUNCHING ROBLOX, AND THAT YOUR TASKBAR IS *DISABLED***
9. After your first launch, a settings.ini file will be saved. Do not be scared, it is just to save your minimum VTP setting. It is not a virus.

# ***KNOWN ISSUES***

1. One user has reported the bot rerolling a 4 VTP server when minimum was set to 4 on *1080p*. 1440p has been tested extensively and should work, however 1080p is much less confident.
2. If roblox decides not to open upon clicking join, or opens then closes, you **may** have to manually click to join again. I've tried fixing / finding a workaround, but i don't think i can.
3. VTP 6 and above are not in reference_images. This means if you get a VTP 6 server, it will automatically TRY to reroll it. If you are trying for one, i would stop the macro if you see one, and then take a screenshot of the VTP_6 using snipping tool while still having roblox on the right half of your screen, and then add it to "reference_images." **DM ME ANY NEW REFERENCE IMAGES IF YOU CAN, WOULD BE INCREDIBLY APPRECIATED.*
